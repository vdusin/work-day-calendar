# work-day-calendar

## Description
A simple work calendar showing hours from 9AM to 5PM. The code is used to take the user input data and put it to the internal storage, add the current date to the header, and color code the timeblocks by current time. This activity is used to work through applications using Javascript and jQuery. 
 
A TA did help me with my code.

## Usage
The user can save typed information into the time blocks and click the save icon to save the info to the internal storage. The application works with the current time by displaying the current time as red, the past time as white, and the future time as green. The top of the page displays the current date. 

Dev tools can be used by right clicking on the deployed wepage and clicking inspect. This will show the console to the right.
